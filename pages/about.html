	          <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Jamie Conway and I am a full stack developer with a diverse background in entrepreneurship, food science, and  biomedical science. I have 5 years of experience in the field of software development, and owned and operated a small restaurant in the heart of downtown Oklahoma City for 7.5 years. I am one of the founders of <a href="https://www.nourishedfood.co" target="_blank">Nourished Co</a>.</p>
            <p>This site is a work-in-progress using what I've learned in the <a href="https://www.okcoders.com/" target="_blank">OKCoders</a> bootcamp.</p>
            <p>As a full stack developer, I have a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end development, and I am comfortable working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks. I am committed to creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that provide an outstanding user experience, as well as robust and reliable back-end systems that can handle heavy traffic and large amounts of data.</p>
            <p>My background in biomedical science has provided me with a unique perspective and a deep understanding of complex scientific concepts. I am able to leverage my expertise to create software solutions that meet the needs of scientists, researchers, and healthcare professionals. I am passionate about using technology to improve healthcare outcomes and to drive innovation in the industry.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a collaborative team player who thrives in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. I am a clear communicator who can articulate complex technical and scientific concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. My ability to bridge the gap between technology and science makes me an asset to any team.</p>
            <p>I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to your organization as a full stack developer. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if you would like to discuss potential job opportunities. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
            <p>I have work experience building websites using many different tech stacks including wordpress (LAMP), django, flask, react, node...</p>
            <p id="backend">Backend experience includes: neo4j, cypher, mongoDB, mongoose.</p>
            <p>I'm obsessed with learning new languages, and building projects to be fun and appealing to use!</p>
            <p id="for-hire">I am  open for  work - feel free to contact me at any time. Contact me for work via email at forhire@jpconway.com.</p>
