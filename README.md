# jpconway-website
A new portfolio website-in-progress to host information about myself as a resume.
Built using _only_ topics covered-to-date within the OKCoders bootcamp.
This site will likely remain hosted on github pages as static html. 
I have written all code without the use of any frameworks, all by hand! The reason for this is to establish that I have an understanding of the base principles of web development, and that I can utilize available tools to produce a functioning web site.
