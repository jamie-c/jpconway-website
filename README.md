# jpconway-website

This project has been archived, and is the first version of my website, initially written in plain html and css, then updated with javascript.
See the next.js version of my website in the jpconway repo.

A new portfolio website-in-progress to host information about myself as a resume.
Built using _only_ topics covered-to-date within the OKCoders bootcamp.
This site will likely remain hosted on github pages as static html. 
I have written all code without the use of any frameworks, all by hand! The reason for this is to establish that I have an understanding of the base principles of web development, and that I can utilize available tools to produce a functioning web site.
